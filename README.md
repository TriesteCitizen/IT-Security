This project is a small compilation of different IT-Security workflows to improve my understanding and knowledge for different topics. ü•≥

Each package will contain example code with a README that goes in depth for that specific code and explains it. I might include Anki cards.
As of now. Following topics have been covered:
- AES/RSA Encryption and Decryption (Symmetrical vs. Asymmetrical)





Mini projects for the future I plan on doing are:
- Simple Keylogger with logging in file (educational) ‚ùå
- ARP Spoofing Demo with Scapy ‚ùå
- SMTP Header Injection Example ‚ùå
- Webapp with Login + XSS Injection Demo + Fix ‚ùå
- "What does this Malware Code do?" - statical analysis of a simulated virus ‚ùå
- "What's a digital signature?" - with code examples ‚ùå
